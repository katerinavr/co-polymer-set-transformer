The soluble oligomeric analogues M1, M2, and M3 were synthesized by symmetrical and repeated substitution of the donor 3,4-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene (DOT-(OEtHx)2) onto the acceptor core 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) (ref. 32); the molecular structures of M1, M2, and M3 are shown in Fig. 1a; absorption spectra are reported in Supplementary Information, Fig. S1. The oligomers were then subsequently polymerized affording P1, P2, and P3, the optical properties of which were investigated as a function of the length of the donor-based conjugated chromophores (2?m) spacing BTD along the backbones; the molecular structures of P1, P2, and P3 are shown in Fig. 1a. We attribute the dark wine hue of P3 to its overall high visible absorbance with minimal red-light transmission. This observation led us to replace the DOT moiety with the strongly donating 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT-(CH2OEtHx)2), which possesses a higher highest occupied molecular orbital and should substantially narrow the bandgap of its subsequent polymer without the need to exchange BTD for a stronger acceptor; the molecular structures of M5, M6, M7, P5, P6, and P7 are shown in Fig. 2a; absorption spectra of the oligomers are reported in Supplementary Information, Fig. S2. As a method to overcome the persistent lack of coverage in the blue and green regions of the visible region, we reasoned that by copolymerizing M5 and M8 (monomer of the subsequent control polymer P8) in a random fashion but in an appropriate feed ratio, the resulting hybrid would exhibit the extensive absorption from 400 to 700?nm required for a black chromophore. This is indeed the case and an optimal ratio was found to be one equivalent of M5 to four equivalents of M8, as illustrated in Fig. 3a and corresponding to that of the repeat unit composing the well-defined analogue P7 in terms of electron-rich to -poor substituents incorporated. The molecular composition of the resulting polymer P9 was confirmed by NMR and elemental analysis; see Supplementary Information, Table S1. A number-average molecular weight of 13.6?kDa and a polydispersity of 2 were estimated by gel permeation chromatography; see Supplementary Information, Table S1. \",\n          \"Palladium-catalyzed direct heteroarylation polymerization (DHAP) conditions previously used to synthesize electron-rich ECPs were followed for the synthesis of each DAT-co-ProDOT copolymer. (72\\u009f??74) Polymerizations were performed in N,N-dimethylacetamide at 140 \\u00f4\\u009bC using palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) as the catalyst, potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as the base, and pivalic acid (PivOH) as the proton shuttle. It is worth noting that attempts using 3,4-bis(octyl)thiophene as the dihydro comonomer yielded an oligomeric material with number-average molecular weights (Mn) \\u009f?\\u00aa4.0\\u009f??7.0 kg/mol as measured via size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) versus polystyrene (PS) standards. Historically, dioxythiophene-based copolymers with Mn values below 10.0 kg/mol neither exhibit sufficient film forming properties during processing for materials with robust redox switching, nor are the polymers in their limit of conjugation length as needed for saturated electronic properties. (75) This motivated the use of Br2-DAT as the dibromo comonomer for polymerization protocols, as shown in Scheme 2. By switching monomer functionality and the corresponding sequence of participation in the DHAP catalytic cycle, copolymers using the respective ProDOT as dihydro comonomers were successfully synthesized. All of the copolymers were isolated in excellent yields (>80%) with similar Mn (20\\u009f??30 kg/mol) and dispersities (D\\u00e8\\u0091 = 2.1\\u009f??3.6) as measured by SEC (Figure S8) and are reported in Table 1. Additionally, as tabulated in Table 1, elemental analyses reveal each copolymer is obtained with high compositional purity, which is necessary to establish accurate structure\\u009f??property relationships.

            "Palladium-catalyzed direct heteroarylation polymerization (DHAP) conditions previously used to synthesize electron-rich ECPs were followed for the synthesis of each DAT-co-ProDOT copolymer.

Historically, dioxythiophene-based copolymers with Mn values below 10.0 kg/mol neither exhibit sufficient film forming properties during processing for materials with robust redox switching, nor are the polymers in their limit of conjugation length as needed for saturated electronic properties. (75) This motivated the use of Br2-DAT as the dibromo comonomer for polymerization protocols, as shown in Scheme 2. By switching monomer functionality and the corresponding sequence of participation in the DHAP catalytic cycle, copolymers using the respective ProDOT as dihydro comonomers were successfully synthesized. All of the copolymers were isolated in excellent yields (>80%) with similar Mn (20??30 kg/mol) and dispersities (Dè = 2.1??3.6) as measured by SEC (Figure S8) and are reported in Table 1.

            "In recent work, we investigated the effect of varying the relative contribution of electron-rich and electron-deficient heterocycles composing the polymer repeat unit on the absorption spectrum of a series of well-defined ?-conjugated polymers containing various DOTs and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) as the accepting component (see Fig. 1a P1?P3).15 These polymers were shown to possess a dual band of absorption in the visible spectrum consisting of a short- and a long-wavelength absorption band, which can be modulated in terms of their relative intensity, wavelength maxima, and absorption onsets as a function of the DA content in the main-chain. In particular, when the local minimum of absorption separating these two optical transitions was positioned in the 500?550-nm range, the resulting ECPs were found to exhibit the color green,16 a color-state historically difficult to achieve in the field of ?-conjugated polymers.17, 18. With the idea of extending this window of transmission into the blue region of the spectrum by fully rejecting the high-energy optical transition into the UV, the synthesis of a strictly alternating DA copolymer of ProDOT and BTD was envisioned (see Fig. 1a, P4a). In contrast with P1??P3, which were chemically polymerized from symmetrical donor??acceptor??donor (DAD) oligomers via the mild oxidizing agent <span class=\"catalyst\">FeCl3</span>,15 a <span class=\"catalyst\">palladium</span>-mediated polycondensation route had to be introduced to afford the desired DA alternating pattern. However, the relative difficulty and particularly low yields associated with the synthesis of difunctionalized organostannane and organoborane derivatives of dioxythiophenes prevented us from using common polymerization methodology, whereby the most electron-poor heterocycle acts as the ??electrophile? (which undergoes oxidative addition) and the electron-rich counterpart acts as the ??nucleophile? (in transmetallation).20, 28-31 Scanning the literature, we found a unique example of a DA copolymer synthesized by inverting the functionalities between donor and acceptor.32, 33 In this work, BTD was difunctionalized with pinacol ester-protected boronic acid in a one-step Miyaura borylation. Upon optimization of the step relative to the synthesis of the organoborane derivative of BTD (see Experimental section), two dialkoxy-substituted ProDOT??BTD copolymers (namely P4a and P4b) were subsequently produced in excellent yields (>90%), with number average molecular weights (Mn) as high as 23 kDa by using traditional Suzuki cross-coupling conditions (see Fig. 1c). In addition, a didodecylester-substituted DA analogue, namely P4c, was successfully achieved (Mn??=??11.1??kDa) using a modification of the base-free Suzuki conditions described earlier by our group.34 Overall, the low toxicity of the reagents used, combined with the simplicity and the scalability of the synthetic pathway described in Figure 1c, makes this process attractive for the production of these materials on an industrial scale. Encouraged by the excellent results obtained with P4a and P4b in terms of contrast, response times, and switching stability, we developed the didodecylester-substituted DA copolymer analogue P4c with the perspective of cleaving its solubilizing side chains via a basic hydrolysis of the esters (saponification) achieved directly from the thin films. Conjugated polymers that can be solution-processed and, subsequently, defunctionalized to produce films insoluble in most conventional organic solvents have recently emerged for use in EC and multilayer light-emitting diode (LED) devices,38 transistors,39 and photovoltaic cells.40 In the case of P4c, we found that the spray-cast polymer can be effectively defunctionalized by immersing the films in a <span class=\"solvent\">1??M KOH methanol</span> solution for 4??h at 70??ôC. As demonstrated in Figure 3a, the same conditions can be applied to the saponification of the finely ground polymer itself, hence, replacing the aliphatic esters by carboxylate functionalities on each ProDOT heterocycle along the backbone. Here, the conversion from the esters to the carboxylates is evidenced by a distinct shift of the C??¢O stretching band towards lower frequencies (from 1734 to 1560??cm??1), along with a broadening of the corresponding band. In parallel, the loss of the aliphatic side chains is clearly visible through the depletion of the C??ùH-stretching-band intensity at higher frequencies (2800??3000??cm??1).\n",

            "The approach to the polymer syntheses is shown in Scheme 1. The polymers were prepared via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization where the ratios of the monomers allow for tuning the color. The stoichiometry is balanced by using the proper proportions of ProDOT and ProDOT-Br2 such that the aryl bond carbon??bromide:carbon??hydrogen ratio is equal to 1. The polymerizations were carried out under an <span class=\"base\">argon</span> atmosphere over 24 h followed by precipitation into <span class=\"solvents\">methanol</span>, followed by purification via Soxhlet extraction, during which they were washed with <span class=\"solvents\">methanol</span>, <span class=\"solvents\">acetone</span>, <span class=\"solvents\">hexanes</span>, and <span class=\"solvents\">chloroform</span>. The <span class=\"solvents\">chloroform</span> fraction was retained and underwent <span class=\"catalysts\">palladium</span> and <span class=\"ligands\">potassium</span> scavenging before being reprecipitated, filtered, and dried to afford the desired product. Polymerization yields were all ?ó67%, and GPC-estimated molecular weights were all ?ó10 kDa, relative to a polystyrene standard. These molecular weights show that the polymers are above the effective conjugation length and would not undergo a change in color if they were longer. Polymerization yields and GPC-estimated molecular weights are collated in Table 2, and all GPC traces are shown in Figure S5. As one can see by the elemental analysis results, the polymers tend to have high sulfur percentages and low carbon and hydrogen percentages. This is indicative of incorporation of more biEDOT into the structure compared to what the monomer feed ratio would suggest. This is can be explained by the relative reactivity and solubility of the monomers. DAT is less reactive and is incorporated into the copolymer at a rate slower than that of biEDOT, so there is significant copolymer drift early in the polymerization. As more biEDOT is added to the polymer, the polymer becomes less soluble due to the lack of side chains present in the monomer. This leads to polymers with the most biEDOT to precipitate from the polymerization and thus incorporate less DAT and ProDOT into the structure. Synthetic procedures, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, and elemental analyses are also given in the Supporting Information.

The results, summarized in Table 1, indicated that the polymers are of sufficient molecular weight (Mn ranging from 5 kDa to 44 kDa) where optical properties are expected to become independent of molecular weight. The range in molecular weights of the polymers synthesized in this work can be attributed to differences in their solubility, as dictated by the side chain and backbone structure. The lower molecular weight of P(LAcDOT-DMP), relative to the other polymers, is due to the decreased conformational entropy of the LAcDOT and DMP units, resulting in a lower overall solubility of the copolymer and gelation in the reaction medium, thus limiting the propagation of the polymer chains. The high molecular weight of P(BAcDOT), on the other hand, is attributed to the branched side chains which allows higher molecular weight chains to form without gelation.\n",

            "Synthesis The polymers were prepared by oxidative coupling of the relevant dialkoxythiophene monomers with excess <span class=\"catalyst\">iron(III) chloride</span> in <span class=\"solvent\">ethyl acetate</span> at room temperature, with subsequent reduction by <span class=\"ligand\">hydrazine</span>. The choice of <span class=\"solvent\">ethyl acetate</span> as solvent exploits the excellent solubility of <span class=\"catalyst\">iron(III) chloride</span> in this medium, affording an initially homogeneous reaction mixture, which polymerizes rapidly. It is notable that the conventional solvent system of <span class=\"solvent\">chloroform</span>, or a mixture of <span class=\"solvent\">chloroform</span> and <span class=\"solvent\">methanol</span>, retards polymerization of these dialkoxythiophene moieties. A five-fold excess of oxidant is employed to keep the oxidizing strength of the reaction sufficiently high to maximize yield and molecular weight. In the case of ECP-orange (P1), a very high molecular weight with low polydispersity is achieved (Mn ca. 115?153 kDa, PDI = 1.27 to 1.79) whereas ECP-red (P2) exhibits a lower molecular weight and broader polydispersity (Mn ca. 11?16 kDa, PDI = 2.12?4.38). The yield of ECP-red is consistently modest in the range of 20?30%, with losses incurred through removal of insoluble material of higher molecular weight by filtration. We suspect that the lower molecular weight of ECP-red relative to ECP-orange is due to the decreased conformational entropy of the di(methoxy)thiophene monomer unit relative to the di(ethylhexyloxy)thiophene unit resulting in a lower overall solubility of the copolymer in the reaction medium and thus limiting the propagation of the polymer chain and broadening the polydispersity. Whereas we expect the polymerization proceeds in a near random manner, comparison of the integrals in 1H NMR confirms the 1:1 ratio of 3,4-dimethoxythiophene to 3,4-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene moieties in ECP-red, as shown in the Supporting Information. Both polymers have good solubility in solvents for film-casting (in particular spray casting) and demonstrate excellent film-forming characteristics.

PC (anhydrous, 99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as received and stored under Argon. 3,4-Dimethoxythiophene was purchased from AK Scientific and used as received. 1H NMR spectra were collected on a 300 MHz Varian VXR or a Unity Inova 500 MHz using <span class=\"solvent\">CDCl3</span>.

Injections were made at 0.05 to 0.07% w/v sample concentration using a 220.5 ?L injection volume. Retention times were calibrated against narrow molecular weight polystyrene standards (Polymer Laboratories, Amherst, MA). Synthesis 3,4-(2-Ethylhexyloxy)-thiophene The synthesis of this monomer was reported previously, and has been modified as follows: In a round-bottomed flask, 3,4-dimethoxythiophene (33.4 g, 0.23 mol), 2-ethylhexanol (80 g, 0.61 mol), and p-toulenesulfonic acid monohydrate (4.4 g, 0.023 mol) were combined in <span class=\"solvent\">toluene</span> (1000 mL).

            "Synthetic Approach and Polymer Characterization The repeat unit structures of the polymers examined in this contribution are shown in Chart 1. Following synthetic principles recently introduced by our group for the synthesis of spray-processable green-to-transmissive switching polymer electrochromes, (7a) these repeat units were constructed by flanking two electron-rich moieties ? DalkOT or ProDOT ? to the electron-deficient core BTD, yielding symmetrical macromonomers that could be subsequently polymerized using the oxidizing agent <span class=\"catalyst\">FeCl3</span> (see Figure S1). In addition, the solution-processability of the polymers was probed and tuned by incorporating DalkOT units possessing simple methoxy substituents, as in P2 and P3, as opposed to the branched 2-ethylhexyl substituents systematically appended to ProDOT, as in P6. While P1, P2, and P3 were intentionally designed to be exclusively composed of DalkOT units with the goal to establish direct comparisons with P6, itself exclusively composed of ProDOT units, mixed ProDOT and DalkOT units were used to produce P5 and P4 and to look for intermediate properties. The search for alternate neutral state green hues has motivated the incorporation of single ring thiophene units, as in P7a, P7b, and P8, intrinsically less electron-rich than their DOT counterparts. General procedures for the synthesis of the macromonomers and polymers considered in this study are described in the Supporting Information (SI). As can be seen in the MALDI mass spectrum of P6 in Figure 1, there is a series of peaks that correspond to an oligomer series. The separation of these peaks is 1990 amu, which matches the calculated value of the repeat unit structure of P6. Inspection of the region of the dimer peak reveals a dimer with two chlorine end groups, as well as a cluster of dimers at higher mass with a variety of other end groups. A number of other representative polymer repeat unit structures were confirmed by MALDI-MS, which data are shown in the SI (Figure S2).\n",

(26) The series of ProDOTx?EDOTy (PxEy) copolymers, shown in Scheme 1, were synthesized by DHAP (Scheme 2 and Figure S1). Each of the copolymers was designed to achieve a solubility exceeding 30 mg/mL to be suitable for a wide range of coating methods yielding films with varied thicknesses. To achieve this solubility, PE and PE2 were functionalized with 2-hexyldecyloxy (HD) side chains, whereas shorter 2-ethylhexyloxy (EH) side chains were sufficient for the other copolymers. P2E (Mn: 14.5 kDa; Mw/Mn: 2.0) and P2E2 (Mn: 14.1 kDa; Mw/Mn: 4.5) were synthesized via previously reported methodologies.

            "<p>An approach for producing ECPs with random length chromophores and relaxed steric interactions between EBE?s and substituted 3,4-dioxythiophenes (XDOTs) is illustrated in Scheme 1, where x and y represent comonomer ratios. The blue or green spheres represent either ProDOT or AcDOT; the color representation in the scheme only indicates a difference. Scheme 1. General Polymerization Scheme To Produce Broadly Absorbing ECPs Using a Sterically Relaxed D?A?D Architecturea High Resolution Image Download MS PowerPoint Slide Scheme aGreen and blue represent structurally different dioxythiophenes. Our use of the EBE ter-heterocycle ensures that the BTD acceptor will always be flanked by the less-sterically demanding six-membered rings from the two EDOTs (as opposed to the seven-member ring in ProDOT) in random copolymerizations. We hypothesize that once fully oxidized, this will allow for greater planarization across the D?A?D segment, improving delocalization of charge carriers, red-shifting the charge carrier transitions, imparting higher transmittance to the oxidized forms, and thus increasing electrochromic contrast. Calculations of the torsional energy barrier to rotation between dimers of BTD and EDOT/ProDOT are shown in Figure S1a. Computational studies were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G+(d, p) and MP2/cc-pVTZ level of theory (51, 52) using the Gaussian 09 package. (53) From their lowest relative energy conformation (0ø, Figures S1c?f are taken from angles greater than this conformation) in the neutral state, the BTD-EDOT dimer exhibits a higher torsional energy barrier to twisting away from planarity than BTD-ProDOT. Thus, the calculations support improved ?relaxation? or conjugation when EDOTs are flanking BTD vs ProDOTs. The EBE ter-heterocycle was synthesized using direct arylation coupling methods, (54) followed by purification via sublimation, and washing the resulting red solid with methanol. All polymers in this study were synthesized via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DArP). The final structures are shown in Scheme 2 (specific synthetic methods used can be found in the Supporting Information). Polymer molecular weight was analyzed with gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) in chloroform (results shown in Figure S2), and the number weight-average, dispersity, and degree of polymerization (Mn (kDa), PDI, Xn) relative to polystyrene standards are as follows: Ac-Ac/EBE (27.9, 2.10, 40), Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30 (41.9, 3.38, 52), Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35 (44.7, 4.48, 55), Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 (50.9, 3.20, 64), and Pro-Pro/EBE (68.0, 3.17, 78). Ac-Ac/EBE has the lowest weight, a kinetic effect, which may be attributed to a steric barrier to oxidative addition of the bulkier aryl dibromide, resulting in reduced conversion (Xn) and lower Mn. As the steric barrier is reduced with addition of ProDOTs, the molecular weights increase. The molecular weights obtained were sufficient to cast thin solid films onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass for electrochromic characterization. Scheme 2.

            "In recent work, we reported the synthesis and characterization of the first black-to-transmissive switching polymeric electrochrome based on the donor-acceptor approach.18 We showed that by variation of the relative contribution of electron-rich and -poor moieties in the polymer backbone, the two-band absorption in the visible spectrum could be controlled. In addition, using a particular feed ratio of two different monomers, the discrete absorption bands merged into a broad absorption across the entire visible spectrum. The spray-cast polymer thin film exhibited a deep black neutral state and attained a highly transmissive state when fully oxidized. Due to the synthetic complexity of the polymer, which involved the synthesis and chromatographic separation of DAD trimers, and which may limit reproducible large-scale production of the material, we desired to develop a method that would lead to polymer batches with highly reproducible absorption spectra and an efficient, scalable and consistent polymerization process. As illustrated by Figure 1a, we demonstrate a facile synthetic approach to access black-to-transmissive electrochromic polymers via a random transition-metal mediated coupling polyðmerization. In the specific instance reported here, we use a Stille polymerization; however the method could be applied to many other transition-metal mediated reactions that include Suzuki, Negishi, and Kumada couplings. Under the most common Stille polymerization conditions, two monomers (typically an aryl distannane and an aryl dihalide) are cross-coupled using <span class=\"catalyst\">palladium</span> catalysis to produce polymers with pre-determined Ar-Ar? couplings.33-35 In this approach, we desired to incorporate a random mixture of donor and acceptor heterocycles in order achieve a black polymer by utilizing more than two monomeric species in the polymerizations.36, 37 In order to simulate the ratio of electron-rich to electron-poor heterocycles determined in our previous work, we chose to randomly polymerize both 2,5-dibromo- and 2,5-tributylstannyl-2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT-(CH2OEtHx)2) with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) in different feed ratios. In an optimization of the feed ratio, five random broadly absorbing copolymers (ECP-1 through ECP-5) were produced, with number average molecular weights (Mn) around 10 to 15 kDa and polydispersities ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 after fractionation (see Supporting Information, Table S1). Two additional syntheses of polymer ECP-3 were under taken to demonstrate successful repeatability. The generated polymers ECP-3-s1 and ECP-3-s2 are consistent with ECP-3 in terms of molecular weight (Mn), PDI and solution absorption (see Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S1). As expected, by controlling the feed ratio of the monomers, we were able to effectively manipulate the absorption pattern of the polymers.\n",

The soluble oligomeric analogues M1, M2, and M3 were synthesized by symmetrical and repeated substitution of the donor 3,4-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene (DOT-(OEtHx)2) onto the acceptor core 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) (ref. 32); the molecular structures of M1, M2, and M3 are shown in Fig. 1a; absorption spectra are reported in Supplementary Information, Fig. S1. The oligomers were then subsequently polymerized affording P1, P2, and P3, the optical properties of which were investigated as a function of the length of the donor-based conjugated chromophores (2?m) spacing BTD along the backbones; the molecular structures of P1, P2, and P3 are shown in Fig. 1a. We attribute the dark wine hue of P3 to its overall high visible absorbance with minimal red-light transmission. This observation led us to replace the DOT moiety with the strongly donating 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT-(CH2OEtHx)2), which possesses a higher highest occupied molecular orbital and should substantially narrow the bandgap of its subsequent polymer without the need to exchange BTD for a stronger acceptor; the molecular structures of M5, M6, M7, P5, P6, and P7 are shown in Fig. 2a; absorption spectra of the oligomers are reported in Supplementary Information, Fig. S2. As a method to overcome the persistent lack of coverage in the blue and green regions of the visible region, we reasoned that by copolymerizing M5 and M8 (monomer of the subsequent control polymer P8) in a random fashion but in an appropriate feed ratio, the resulting hybrid would exhibit the extensive absorption from 400 to 700?nm required for a black chromophore. This is indeed the case and an optimal ratio was found to be one equivalent of M5 to four equivalents of M8, as illustrated in Fig. 3a and corresponding to that of the repeat unit composing the well-defined analogue P7 in terms of electron-rich to -poor substituents incorporated. The molecular composition of the resulting polymer P9 was confirmed by NMR and elemental analysis; see Supplementary Information, Table S1.

The synthetic details for the preparation of each monomer are given in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1). All of the monomers used were straightforward to produce and are highly scalable from available starting materials. Boronate monomers can generally be produced in high yield using Miyaura borylation or lithium halogen exchange, often with recrystallization as the only purification step. Additionally, recent advances in iridium catalyzed borylation allowed us to access the 2,7-bisborylated pyrene efficiently. (25) Suzuki polycondensation under optimized conditions was chosen as the method to synthesize the polymers as boronic esters are generally environmentally benign. (26) Scheme 1 Scheme 1. Polymers Synthesized and Examined in This Study The Suzuki condensation reactions afforded polymers with molecular weights over 10 kDa (measured by GPC vs polystyrene standards, THF eluent) after initial precipitation into methanol, with the exception of ProDOT-Py and ProDOT2-Py as these polymers were no longer soluble in toluene as the Suzuki reaction progressed.

            "As there have been no reports of chemoselective Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of chloroarenes with phenylboronic acids bearing a TfO group on the benzene ring, we first optimized the reaction conditions for cross-coupling based on those used by Fu and co-workers.13 Phenylboronic acids bearing a TfO group were easily prepared from iodophenyl triflates through I-Mg exchange reactions.16 Some boronic acids (e.g., 2) were isolated as their trimeric anhydride forms (boroxines). Optimization of a model reaction of 4-chlorotoluene (1) with 2 led to the conditions shown in eq 1.

The synthesis began with chloroarene 7. Alternating use of the Cl-selective and TfO-selective conditions afforded 12 in 4 steps, demonstrating that the repetitive one-step method really worked. The yields in each step were not excellent (72-83%), but over-cross-coupling was not observed. Slight modifications of the conditions in eqs 1 and 2 were required for some steps: the third and fourth steps were found to require higher temperatures, greater amounts of the <span class=\"catalyst\">catalysts</span>, and larger volumes of <span class=\"solvents\">solvents</span> to increase the fluidity of the reaction mixtures. While the target quinquephenyl was arbitrarily chosen, this result strongly suggests that the method under discussion is applicable to the synthesis of various types of oligoarene. In this repetitive one-step method, the alternating use of triflates and chlorides in a different order was expected to work equally well. To demonstrate this, we started with aryl triflate 4, instead of 7, with the aim of synthesizing the same quinquephenyl backbone as 12 (Scheme 2). In this way, quinquephenyl 16 was produced in 4 steps by using the two catalytic systems alternately. In this case, the yields in the steps (93-99%) were higher than those in the previous synthesis (Scheme 1). Although the reason for the higher yields is unclear, we assume that slight differences in the solubility of the substrates are responsible. We next carried out the synthesis of multisubstituted oligoarenes using boronic acids with substituents. An example is shown in Scheme 3. Multisubstituted quaterphenyl 22 was produced in good yield. It should be mentioned that the cross-coupling conditions for chloroarene 18 had to be modified in this synthesis. When 18 was subjected to the conditions described above (<span class=\"catalyst\">Pd2(dba)3</span>, <span class=\"ligand\">P(t-Bu)3 3 HBF4</span>, <span class=\"base\">K3PO4</span>), some aldehydes and a byproduct in which the Cl group was substituted with H were obtained (7-9%). These byproducts are likely to be produced through Pd-mediated oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group and Pd-mediated reduction of the Cl group with the hydride generated by the oxidation step.18 However, we were pleased to find that the use of <span class=\"base\">KF</span> instead of <span class=\"base\">K3PO4</span> suppressed the formation of these byproducts to a significant extent. Therefore, we used <span class=\"base\">KF</span> as the base, albeit slightly less active, throughout the synthetic route. The result shown in Scheme 3 demonstrates that various functional groups, including ester, free hydroxy, alkoxy, and fluoro groups, can be installed into oligoarene structures. Another example of multisubstituted oligoarene synthesis is shown in Scheme 4. The third step from 24 to 25 resulted in modest yield. In addition, 25 and remaining 24 could not be separated. Therefore, the mixture (24:25 = ca. 2:3) was subjected to the next reaction with 17 without isolation of 25. The reaction preferentially occurred at the TfO group of 25 over the Cl group of 24 to produce sexiphenyl 26, which was now isolated with ease. The results of synthesis of these arbitrarily chosen oligoarenes strongly suggest that combinatorial uses of monomer precursors should enable preparation of various oligoarenes by this method.\n",

Historically, dioxythiophene-based copolymers with Mn values below 10.0 kg/mol neither exhibit sufficient film forming properties during processing for materials with robust redox switching, nor are the polymers in their limit of conjugation length as needed for saturated electronic properties. (75) This motivated the use of Br2-DAT as the dibromo comonomer for polymerization protocols, as shown in Scheme 2. By switching monomer functionality and the corresponding sequence of participation in the DHAP catalytic cycle, copolymers using the respective ProDOT as dihydro comonomers were successfully synthesized. All of the copolymers were isolated in excellent yields (>80%) with similar Mn (20\\x9f??30 kg/mol) and dispersities (Dè\\x91 = 2.1\\x9f??3.6) as measured by SEC (Figure S8) and are reported in Table 1.

In particular, when the local minimum of absorption separating these two optical transitions was positioned in the 500?550-nm range, the resulting ECPs were found to exhibit the color green,16 a color-state historically difficult to achieve in the field of ?-conjugated polymers.17, 18. With the idea of extending this window of transmission into the blue region of the spectrum by fully rejecting the high-energy optical transition into the UV, the synthesis of a strictly alternating DA copolymer of ProDOT and BTD was envisioned (see Fig. 1a, P4a). In contrast with P1\\x9f??P3, which were chemically polymerized from symmetrical donor\\x9f??acceptor\\x9f??donor (DAD) oligomers via the mild oxidizing agent <span class=\"catalyst\">FeCl3</span>,15 a <span class=\"catalyst\">palladium</span>-mediated polycondensation route had to be introduced to afford the desired DA alternating pattern. However, the relative difficulty and particularly low yields associated with the synthesis of difunctionalized organostannane and organoborane derivatives of dioxythiophenes prevented us from using common polymerization methodology, whereby the most electron-poor heterocycle acts as the \\x9f??electrophile\\x9f?\\x9d (which undergoes oxidative addition) and the electron-rich counterpart acts as the \\x9f??nucleophile\\x9f?\\x9d (in transmetallation).20, 28-31 Scanning the literature, we found a unique example of a DA copolymer synthesized by inverting the functionalities between donor and acceptor.32, 33 In this work, BTD was difunctionalized with pinacol ester-protected boronic acid in a one-step Miyaura borylation. Upon optimization of the step relative to the synthesis of the organoborane derivative of BTD (see Experimental section), two dialkoxy-substituted ProDOT\\x9f??BTD copolymers (namely P4a and P4b) were subsequently produced in excellent yields (>90%), with number average molecular weights (Mn) as high as 23 kDa by using traditional Suzuki cross-coupling conditions (see Fig. 1c). In addition, a didodecylester-substituted DA analogue, namely P4c, was successfully achieved (Mn\\x9f??=\\x9f??11.1\\x9f??kDa) using a modification of the base-free Suzuki conditions described earlier by our group.34 Overall, the low toxicity of the reagents used, combined with the simplicity and the scalability of the synthetic pathway described in Figure 1c, makes this process attractive for the production of these materials on an industrial scale. Encouraged by the excellent results obtained with P4a and P4b in terms of contrast, response times, and switching stability, we developed the didodecylester-substituted DA copolymer analogue P4c with the perspective of cleaving its solubilizing side chains via a basic hydrolysis of the esters (saponification) achieved directly from the thin films. Conjugated polymers that can be solution-processed and, subsequently, defunctionalized to produce films insoluble in most conventional organic solvents have recently emerged for use in EC and multilayer light-emitting diode (LED) devices,38 transistors,39 and photovoltaic cells.40 In the case of P4c, we found that the spray-cast polymer can be effectively defunctionalized by immersing the films in a <span class=\"solvent\">1\\x9f??M KOH methanol</span> solution for 4\\x9f??h at 70\\x9f??ô\\x9bC. As demonstrated in Figure 3a, the same conditions can be applied to the saponification of the finely ground polymer itself, hence, replacing the aliphatic esters by carboxylate functionalities on each ProDOT heterocycle along the backbone. Here, the conversion from the esters to the carboxylates is evidenced by a distinct shift of the C??¢O stretching band towards lower frequencies (from 1734 to 1560\\x9f??cm\\x9f??1), along with a broadening of the corresponding band. In parallel, the loss of the aliphatic side chains is clearly visible through the depletion of the C??ùH-stretching-band intensity at higher frequencies (2800\\x9f??3000\\x9f??cm\\x9f??1).\\n```',\n",

The polymers were prepared via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization where the ratios of the monomers allow for tuning the color. The stoichiometry is balanced by using the proper proportions of ProDOT and ProDOT-Br2 such that the aryl bond carbon\\x9f??bromide:carbon\\x9f??hydrogen ratio is equal to 1. The polymerizations were carried out under an <span class=\"base\">argon</span> atmosphere over 24 h followed by precipitation into <span class=\"solvents\">methanol</span>, followed by purification via Soxhlet extraction, during which they were washed with <span class=\"solvents\">methanol</span>, <span class=\"solvents\">acetone</span>, <span class=\"solvents\">hexanes</span>, and <span class=\"solvents\">chloroform</span>. The <span class=\"solvents\">chloroform</span> fraction was retained and underwent <span class=\"catalysts\">palladium</span> and <span class=\"ligands\">potassium</span> scavenging before being reprecipitated, filtered, and dried to afford the desired product. Polymerization yields were all \\x9f?ó67%, and GPC-estimated molecular weights were all \\x9f?ó10 kDa, relative to a polystyrene standard. These molecular weights show that the polymers are above the effective conjugation length and would not undergo a change in color if they were longer. Polymerization yields and GPC-estimated molecular weights are collated in Table 2, and all GPC traces are shown in Figure S5. As one can see by the elemental analysis results, the polymers tend to have high sulfur percentages and low carbon and hydrogen percentages. This is indicative of incorporation of more biEDOT into the structure compared to what the monomer feed ratio would suggest. This is can be explained by the relative reactivity and solubility of the monomers. DAT is less reactive and is incorporated into the copolymer at a rate slower than that of biEDOT, so there is significant copolymer drift early in the polymerization. As more biEDOT is added to the polymer, the polymer becomes less soluble due to the lack of side chains present in the monomer. This leads to polymers with the most biEDOT to precipitate from the polymerization and thus incorporate less DAT and ProDOT into the structure. Synthetic procedures, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, and elemental analyses are also given in the Supporting Information. All polymers are soluble in <span class=\"solvents\">CHCl<sub>3</sub></span> upward of 5 mg/mL allowing for airbrush spray processing and drop casting for film formation.\\n```',\n",

The results, summarized in Table 1, indicated that the polymers are of sufficient molecular weight (Mn ranging from 5 kDa to 44 kDa) where optical properties are expected to become independent of molecular weight. The range in molecular weights of the polymers synthesized in this work can be attributed to differences in their solubility, as dictated by the side chain and backbone structure. The lower molecular weight of P(LAcDOT-DMP), relative to the other polymers, is due to the decreased conformational entropy of the LAcDOT and DMP units, resulting in a lower overall solubility of the copolymer and gelation in the reaction medium, thus limiting the propagation of the polymer chains. The high molecular weight of P(BAcDOT), on the other hand, is attributed to the branched side chains which allows higher molecular weight chains to form without gelation.\\n```',\n",

The choice of <span class=\"solvent\">ethyl acetate</span> as solvent exploits the excellent solubility of <span class=\"catalyst\">iron(III) chloride</span> in this medium, affording an initially homogeneous reaction mixture, which polymerizes rapidly. It is notable that the conventional solvent system of <span class=\"solvent\">chloroform</span>, or a mixture of <span class=\"solvent\">chloroform</span> and <span class=\"solvent\">methanol</span>, retards polymerization of these dialkoxythiophene moieties. A five-fold excess of oxidant is employed to keep the oxidizing strength of the reaction sufficiently high to maximize yield and molecular weight. In the case of ECP-orange (P1), a very high molecular weight with low polydispersity is achieved (Mn ca. 115?153 kDa, PDI = 1.27 to 1.79) whereas ECP-red (P2) exhibits a lower molecular weight and broader polydispersity (Mn ca. 11?16 kDa, PDI = 2.12?4.38). The yield of ECP-red is consistently modest in the range of 20?30%, with losses incurred through removal of insoluble material of higher molecular weight by filtration. We suspect that the lower molecular weight of ECP-red relative to ECP-orange is due to the decreased conformational entropy of the di(methoxy)thiophene monomer unit relative to the di(ethylhexyloxy)thiophene unit resulting in a lower overall solubility of the copolymer in the reaction medium and thus limiting the propagation of the polymer chain and broadening the polydispersity. Whereas we expect the polymerization proceeds in a near random manner, comparison of the integrals in 1H NMR confirms the 1:1 ratio of 3,4-dimethoxythiophene to 3,4-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene moieties in ECP-red, as shown in the Supporting Information.

Following synthetic principles recently introduced by our group for the synthesis of spray-processable green-to-transmissive switching polymer electrochromes, (7a) these repeat units were constructed by flanking two electron-rich moieties ? DalkOT or ProDOT ? to the electron-deficient core BTD, yielding symmetrical macromonomers that could be subsequently polymerized using the oxidizing agent <span class=\"catalyst\">FeCl3</span> (see Figure S1). In addition, the solution-processability of the polymers was probed and tuned by incorporating DalkOT units possessing simple methoxy substituents, as in P2 and P3, as opposed to the branched 2-ethylhexyl substituents systematically appended to ProDOT, as in P6. While P1, P2, and P3 were intentionally designed to be exclusively composed of DalkOT units with the goal to establish direct comparisons with P6, itself exclusively composed of ProDOT units, mixed ProDOT and DalkOT units were used to produce P5 and P4 and to look for intermediate properties. The search for alternate neutral state green hues has motivated the incorporation of single ring thiophene units, as in P7a, P7b, and P8, intrinsically less electron-rich than their DOT counterparts. General procedures for the synthesis of the macromonomers and polymers considered in this study are described in the Supporting Information (SI). As can be seen in the MALDI mass spectrum of P6 in Figure 1, there is a series of peaks that correspond to an oligomer series. The separation of these peaks is 1990 amu, which matches the calculated value of the repeat unit structure of P6. Inspection of the region of the dimer peak reveals a dimer with two chlorine end groups, as well as a cluster of dimers at higher mass with a variety of other end groups. A number of other representative polymer repeat unit structures were confirmed by MALDI-MS, which data are shown in the SI (Figure S2).\\n```',\n",

General Polymerization Scheme To Produce Broadly Absorbing ECPs Using a Sterically Relaxed D?A?D Architecturea High Resolution Image Download MS PowerPoint Slide Scheme aGreen and blue represent structurally different dioxythiophenes. Our use of the EBE ter-heterocycle ensures that the BTD acceptor will always be flanked by the less-sterically demanding six-membered rings from the two EDOTs (as opposed to the seven-member ring in ProDOT) in random copolymerizations. We hypothesize that once fully oxidized, this will allow for greater planarization across the D?A?D segment, improving delocalization of charge carriers, red-shifting the charge carrier transitions, imparting higher transmittance to the oxidized forms, and thus increasing electrochromic contrast. Calculations of the torsional energy barrier to rotation between dimers of BTD and EDOT/ProDOT are shown in Figure S1a. Computational studies were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G+(d, p) and MP2/cc-pVTZ level of theory (51, 52) using the Gaussian 09 package. (53) From their lowest relative energy conformation (0ø, Figures S1c?f are taken from angles greater than this conformation) in the neutral state, the BTD-EDOT dimer exhibits a higher torsional energy barrier to twisting away from planarity than BTD-ProDOT. Thus, the calculations support improved ?relaxation? or conjugation when EDOTs are flanking BTD vs ProDOTs. The EBE ter-heterocycle was synthesized using direct arylation coupling methods, (54) followed by purification via sublimation, and washing the resulting red solid with methanol. All polymers in this study were synthesized via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DArP). The final structures are shown in Scheme 2 (specific synthetic methods used can be found in the Supporting Information). Polymer molecular weight was analyzed with gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) in chloroform (results shown in Figure S2), and the number weight-average, dispersity, and degree of polymerization (Mn (kDa), PDI, Xn) relative to polystyrene standards are as follows: Ac-Ac/EBE (27.9, 2.10, 40), Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30 (41.9, 3.38, 52), Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35 (44.7, 4.48, 55), Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 (50.9, 3.20, 64), and Pro-Pro/EBE (68.0, 3.17, 78). Ac-Ac/EBE has the lowest weight, a kinetic effect, which may be attributed to a steric barrier to oxidative addition of the bulkier aryl dibromide, resulting in reduced conversion (Xn) and lower Mn. As the steric barrier is reduced with addition of ProDOTs, the molecular weights increase.

In addition, using a particular feed ratio of two different monomers, the discrete absorption bands merged into a broad absorption across the entire visible spectrum. The spray-cast polymer thin film exhibited a deep black neutral state and attained a highly transmissive state when fully oxidized. Due to the synthetic complexity of the polymer, which involved the synthesis and chromatographic separation of DAD trimers, and which may limit reproducible large-scale production of the material, we desired to develop a method that would lead to polymer batches with highly reproducible absorption spectra and an efficient, scalable and consistent polymerization process. As illustrated by Figure 1a, we demonstrate a facile synthetic approach to access black-to-transmissive electrochromic polymers via a random transition-metal mediated coupling polyðmerization. In the specific instance reported here, we use a Stille polymerization; however the method could be applied to many other transition-metal mediated reactions that include Suzuki, Negishi, and Kumada couplings. Under the most common Stille polymerization conditions, two monomers (typically an aryl distannane and an aryl dihalide) are cross-coupled using <span class=\"catalyst\">palladium</span> catalysis to produce polymers with pre-determined Ar-Ar? couplings.33-35 In this approach, we desired to incorporate a random mixture of donor and acceptor heterocycles in order achieve a black polymer by utilizing more than two monomeric species in the polymerizations.36, 37 In order to simulate the ratio of electron-rich to electron-poor heterocycles determined in our previous work, we chose to randomly polymerize both 2,5-dibromo- and 2,5-tributylstannyl-2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT-(CH2OEtHx)2) with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) in different feed ratios. In an optimization of the feed ratio, five random broadly absorbing copolymers (ECP-1 through ECP-5) were produced, with number average molecular weights (Mn) around 10 to 15 kDa and polydispersities ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 after fractionation (see Supporting Information, Table S1). Two additional syntheses of polymer ECP-3 were under taken to demonstrate successful repeatability. The generated polymers ECP-3-s1 and ECP-3-s2 are consistent with ECP-3 in terms of molecular weight (Mn), PDI and solution absorption (see Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S1).

We attribute the dark wine hue of P3 to its overall high visible absorbance with minimal red-light transmission. This observation led us to replace the DOT moiety with the strongly donating 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT-(CH2OEtHx)2), which possesses a higher highest occupied molecular orbital and should substantially narrow the bandgap of its subsequent polymer without the need to exchange BTD for a stronger acceptor; the molecular structures of M5, M6, M7, P5, P6, and P7 are shown in Fig. 2a; absorption spectra of the oligomers are reported in Supplementary Information, Fig. S2.

This is indeed the case and an optimal ratio was found to be one equivalent of M5 to four equivalents of M8, as illustrated in Fig. 3a and corresponding to that of the repeat unit composing the well-defined analogue P7 in terms of electron-rich to -poor substituents incorporated.

Additionally, recent advances in iridium catalyzed borylation allowed us to access the 2,7-bisborylated pyrene efficiently.

Optimization of a model reaction of 4-chlorotoluene (1) with 2 led to the conditions shown in eq 1. As in Fu\\x92s examples,13 the TfO group of the boronic acid remained intact under these conditions, and longer oligoarene byproducts were not produced. While <span class=\"base\">KF</span> also worked as a base, <span class=\"base\">K3PO4</span> was found to be slightly more active, giving 3 in higher yield. There are some examples in the literature of reactions of aryl triflates with phenylboronic acids bearing a Cl group.17 Screening of catalytic conditions for a model reaction of 4 with 5 showed that the conditions shown in eq 2 were optimal. A combination of <span class=\"catalyst\">Pd(OAc)2</span> (<span class=\"ligand\">3 mol %</span>) and <span class=\"ligand\">PCy3</span> (<span class=\"ligand\">6 mol %</span>) also gave 6 in good yield (75%), but a small amount of the terphenyl byproduct was formed through an overreaction (over-cross-coupling) at the Cl group. Therefore, we decided to use <span class=\"ligand\">1,10 -bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF)</span> for this chemoselective cross-coupling.17b We then applied the reaction conditions to oligomer synthesis, as shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis began with chloroarene 7. Alternating use of the Cl-selective and TfO-selective conditions afforded 12 in 4 steps, demonstrating that the repetitive one-step method really worked. The yields in each step were not excellent (72-83%), but over-cross-coupling was not observed. Slight modifications of the conditions in eqs 1 and 2 were required for some steps: the third and fourth steps were found to require higher temperatures, greater amounts of the <span class=\"catalyst\">catalysts</span>, and larger volumes of <span class=\"solvents\">solvents</span> to increase the fluidity of the reaction mixtures. While the target quinquephenyl was arbitrarily chosen, this result strongly suggests that the method under discussion is applicable to the synthesis of various types of oligoarene. In this repetitive one-step method, the alternating use of triflates and chlorides in a different order was expected to work equally well. To demonstrate this, we started with aryl triflate 4, instead of 7, with the aim of synthesizing the same quinquephenyl backbone as 12 (Scheme 2). In this way, quinquephenyl 16 was produced in 4 steps by using the two catalytic systems alternately. In this case, the yields in the steps (93-99%) were higher than those in the previous synthesis (Scheme 1). Although the reason for the higher yields is unclear, we assume that slight differences in the solubility of the substrates are responsible. We next carried out the synthesis of multisubstituted oligoarenes using boronic acids with substituents. An example is shown in Scheme 3. Multisubstituted quaterphenyl 22 was produced in good yield. It should be mentioned that the cross-coupling conditions for chloroarene 18 had to be modified in this synthesis. When 18 was subjected to the conditions described above (<span class=\"catalyst\">Pd2(dba)3</span>, <span class=\"ligand\">P(t-Bu)3 3 HBF4</span>, <span class=\"base\">K3PO4</span>), some aldehydes and a byproduct in which the Cl group was substituted with H were obtained (7-9%). These byproducts are likely to be produced through Pd-mediated oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group and Pd-mediated reduction of the Cl group with the hydride generated by the oxidation step.18 However, we were pleased to find that the use of <span class=\"base\">KF</span> instead of <span class=\"base\">K3PO4</span> suppressed the formation of these byproducts to a significant extent. Therefore, we used <span class=\"base\">KF</span> as the base, albeit slightly less active, throughout the synthetic route. The result shown in Scheme 3 demonstrates that various functional groups, including ester, free hydroxy, alkoxy, and fluoro groups, can be installed into oligoarene structures. Another example of multisubstituted oligoarene synthesis is shown in Scheme 4. The third step from 24 to 25 resulted in modest yield. In addition, 25 and remaining 24 could not be separated. Therefore, the mixture (24:25 = ca. 2:3) was subjected to the next reaction with 17 without isolation of 25. The reaction preferentially occurred at the TfO group of 25 over the Cl group of 24 to produce sexiphenyl 26, which was now isolated with ease. The results of synthesis of these arbitrarily chosen oligoarenes strongly suggest that combinatorial uses of monomer precursors should enable preparation of various oligoarenes by this method.\\n```',\n",

Historically, dioxythiophene-based copolymers with Mn values below 10.0 kg/mol neither exhibit sufficient film forming properties during processing for materials with robust redox switching, nor are the polymers in their limit of conjugation length as needed for saturated electronic properties. (75) This motivated the use of Br2-DAT as the dibromo comonomer for polymerization protocols, as shown in Scheme 2. By switching monomer functionality and the corresponding sequence of participation in the DHAP catalytic cycle, copolymers using the respective ProDOT as dihydro comonomers were successfully synthesized. All of the copolymers were isolated in excellent yields (>80%) with similar Mn (20\\x9f??30 kg/mol) and dispersities (Dè\\x91 = 2.1\\x9f??3.6) as measured by SEC (Figure S8) and are reported in Table 1.

              "       '```html\\nThis is a paragraph related to polymers synthesis.\\n\\nContext:\\nIn recent work, we investigated the effect of varying the relative contribution of electron-rich and electron-deficient heterocycles composing the polymer repeat unit on the absorption spectrum of a series of well-defined ?-conjugated polymers containing various DOTs and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) as the accepting component (see Fig. 1a P1?P3).15 These polymers were shown to possess a dual band of absorption in the visible spectrum consisting of a short- and a long-wavelength absorption band, which can be modulated in terms of their relative intensity, wavelength maxima, and absorption onsets as a function of the DA content in the main-chain. In particular, when the local minimum of absorption separating these two optical transitions was positioned in the 500?550-nm range, the resulting ECPs were found to exhibit the color green,16 a color-state historically difficult to achieve in the field of ?-conjugated polymers.17, 18. With the idea of extending this window of transmission into the blue region of the spectrum by fully rejecting the high-energy optical transition into the UV, the synthesis of a strictly alternating DA copolymer of ProDOT and BTD was envisioned (see Fig. 1a, P4a). In contrast with P1\\x9f??P3, which were chemically polymerized from symmetrical donor\\x9f??acceptor\\x9f??donor (DAD) oligomers via the mild oxidizing agent <span class=\"catalyst\">FeCl3</span>,15 a <span class=\"catalyst\">palladium</span>-mediated polycondensation route had to be introduced to afford the desired DA alternating pattern. However, the relative difficulty and particularly low yields associated with the synthesis of difunctionalized organostannane and organoborane derivatives of dioxythiophenes prevented us from using common polymerization methodology, whereby the most electron-poor heterocycle acts as the \\x9f??electrophile\\x9f?\\x9d (which undergoes oxidative addition) and the electron-rich counterpart acts as the \\x9f??nucleophile\\x9f?\\x9d (in transmetallation).20, 28-31 Scanning the literature, we found a unique example of a DA copolymer synthesized by inverting the functionalities between donor and acceptor.32, 33 In this work, BTD was difunctionalized with pinacol ester-protected boronic acid in a one-step Miyaura borylation. Upon optimization of the step relative to the synthesis of the organoborane derivative of BTD (see Experimental section), two dialkoxy-substituted ProDOT\\x9f??BTD copolymers (namely P4a and P4b) were subsequently produced in excellent yields (>90%), with number average molecular weights (Mn) as high as 23 kDa by using traditional Suzuki cross-coupling conditions (see Fig. 1c). In addition, a didodecylester-substituted DA analogue, namely P4c, was successfully achieved (Mn\\x9f??=\\x9f??11.1\\x9f??kDa) using a modification of the base-free Suzuki conditions described earlier by our group.34 Overall, the low toxicity of the reagents used, combined with the simplicity and the scalability of the synthetic pathway described in Figure 1c, makes this process attractive for the production of these materials on an industrial scale. Encouraged by the excellent results obtained with P4a and P4b in terms of contrast, response times, and switching stability, we developed the didodecylester-substituted DA copolymer analogue P4c with the perspective of cleaving its solubilizing side chains via a basic hydrolysis of the esters (saponification) achieved directly from the thin films. Conjugated polymers that can be solution-processed and, subsequently, defunctionalized to produce films insoluble in most conventional organic solvents have recently emerged for use in EC and multilayer light-emitting diode (LED) devices,38 transistors,39 and photovoltaic cells.40 In the case of P4c, we found that the spray-cast polymer can be effectively defunctionalized by immersing the films in a <span class=\"solvent\">1\\x9f??M KOH methanol</span> solution for 4\\x9f??h at 70\\x9f??ô\\x9bC. As demonstrated in Figure 3a, the same conditions can be applied to the saponification of the finely ground polymer itself, hence, replacing the aliphatic esters by carboxylate functionalities on each ProDOT heterocycle along the backbone. Here, the conversion from the esters to the carboxylates is evidenced by a distinct shift of the C??¢O stretching band towards lower frequencies (from 1734 to 1560\\x9f??cm\\x9f??1), along with a broadening of the corresponding band. In parallel, the loss of the aliphatic side chains is clearly visible through the depletion of the C??ùH-stretching-band intensity at higher frequencies (2800\\x9f??3000\\x9f??cm\\x9f??1).\\n```',\n",

The polymers were prepared via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization where the ratios of the monomers allow for tuning the color. The stoichiometry is balanced by using the proper proportions of ProDOT and ProDOT-Br2 such that the aryl bond carbon\\x9f??bromide:carbon\\x9f??hydrogen ratio is equal to 1. The polymerizations were carried out under an <span class=\"base\">argon</span> atmosphere over 24 h followed by precipitation into <span class=\"solvents\">methanol</span>, followed by purification via Soxhlet extraction, during which they were washed with <span class=\"solvents\">methanol</span>, <span class=\"solvents\">acetone</span>, <span class=\"solvents\">hexanes</span>, and <span class=\"solvents\">chloroform</span>. The <span class=\"solvents\">chloroform</span> fraction was retained and underwent <span class=\"catalysts\">palladium</span> and <span class=\"ligands\">potassium</span> scavenging before being reprecipitated, filtered, and dried to afford the desired product. Polymerization yields were all \\x9f?ó67%, and GPC-estimated molecular weights were all \\x9f?ó10 kDa, relative to a polystyrene standard. These molecular weights show that the polymers are above the effective conjugation length and would not undergo a change in color if they were longer. Polymerization yields and GPC-estimated molecular weights are collated in Table 2, and all GPC traces are shown in Figure S5. As one can see by the elemental analysis results, the polymers tend to have high sulfur percentages and low carbon and hydrogen percentages. This is indicative of incorporation of more biEDOT into the structure compared to what the monomer feed ratio would suggest. This is can be explained by the relative reactivity and solubility of the monomers. DAT is less reactive and is incorporated into the copolymer at a rate slower than that of biEDOT, so there is significant copolymer drift early in the polymerization. As more biEDOT is added to the polymer, the polymer becomes less soluble due to the lack of side chains present in the monomer. This leads to polymers with the most biEDOT to precipitate from the polymerization and thus incorporate less DAT and ProDOT into the structure. Synthetic procedures, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, and elemental analyses are also given in the Supporting Information. All polymers are soluble in <span class=\"solvents\">CHCl<sub>3</sub></span> upward of 5 mg/mL allowing for airbrush spray processing and drop casting for film formation.\\n```',\n",

The results, summarized in Table 1, indicated that the polymers are of sufficient molecular weight (Mn ranging from 5 kDa to 44 kDa) where optical properties are expected to become independent of molecular weight. The range in molecular weights of the polymers synthesized in this work can be attributed to differences in their solubility, as dictated by the side chain and backbone structure. The lower molecular weight of P(LAcDOT-DMP), relative to the other polymers, is due to the decreased conformational entropy of the LAcDOT and DMP units, resulting in a lower overall solubility of the copolymer and gelation in the reaction medium, thus limiting the propagation of the polymer chains. The high molecular weight of P(BAcDOT), on the other hand, is attributed to the branched side chains which allows higher molecular weight chains to form without gelation.\\n```',\n",

The choice of <span class=\"solvent\">ethyl acetate</span> as solvent exploits the excellent solubility of <span class=\"catalyst\">iron(III) chloride</span> in this medium, affording an initially homogeneous reaction mixture, which polymerizes rapidly. It is notable that the conventional solvent system of <span class=\"solvent\">chloroform</span>, or a mixture of <span class=\"solvent\">chloroform</span> and <span class=\"solvent\">methanol</span>, retards polymerization of these dialkoxythiophene moieties. A five-fold excess of oxidant is employed to keep the oxidizing strength of the reaction sufficiently high to maximize yield and molecular weight. In the case of ECP-orange (P1), a very high molecular weight with low polydispersity is achieved (Mn ca. 115?153 kDa, PDI = 1.27 to 1.79) whereas ECP-red (P2) exhibits a lower molecular weight and broader polydispersity (Mn ca. 11?16 kDa, PDI = 2.12?4.38). The yield of ECP-red is consistently modest in the range of 20?30%, with losses incurred through removal of insoluble material of higher molecular weight by filtration. We suspect that the lower molecular weight of ECP-red relative to ECP-orange is due to the decreased conformational entropy of the di(methoxy)thiophene monomer unit relative to the di(ethylhexyloxy)thiophene unit resulting in a lower overall solubility of the copolymer in the reaction medium and thus limiting the propagation of the polymer chain and broadening the polydispersity. Whereas we expect the polymerization proceeds in a near random manner, comparison of the integrals in 1H NMR confirms the 1:1 ratio of 3,4-dimethoxythiophene to 3,4-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene moieties in ECP-red, as shown in the Supporting Information.

Following synthetic principles recently introduced by our group for the synthesis of spray-processable green-to-transmissive switching polymer electrochromes, (7a) these repeat units were constructed by flanking two electron-rich moieties ? DalkOT or ProDOT ? to the electron-deficient core BTD, yielding symmetrical macromonomers that could be subsequently polymerized using the oxidizing agent <span class=\"catalyst\">FeCl3</span> (see Figure S1). In addition, the solution-processability of the polymers was probed and tuned by incorporating DalkOT units possessing simple methoxy substituents, as in P2 and P3, as opposed to the branched 2-ethylhexyl substituents systematically appended to ProDOT, as in P6. While P1, P2, and P3 were intentionally designed to be exclusively composed of DalkOT units with the goal to establish direct comparisons with P6, itself exclusively composed of ProDOT units, mixed ProDOT and DalkOT units were used to produce P5 and P4 and to look for intermediate properties. The search for alternate neutral state green hues has motivated the incorporation of single ring thiophene units, as in P7a, P7b, and P8, intrinsically less electron-rich than their DOT counterparts. General procedures for the synthesis of the macromonomers and polymers considered in this study are described in the Supporting Information (SI). As can be seen in the MALDI mass spectrum of P6 in Figure 1, there is a series of peaks that correspond to an oligomer series. The separation of these peaks is 1990 amu, which matches the calculated value of the repeat unit structure of P6. Inspection of the region of the dimer peak reveals a dimer with two chlorine end groups, as well as a cluster of dimers at higher mass with a variety of other end groups. A number of other representative polymer repeat unit structures were confirmed by MALDI-MS, which data are shown in the SI (Figure S2).\\n```',\n",

General Polymerization Scheme To Produce Broadly Absorbing ECPs Using a Sterically Relaxed D?A?D Architecturea High Resolution Image Download MS PowerPoint Slide Scheme aGreen and blue represent structurally different dioxythiophenes. Our use of the EBE ter-heterocycle ensures that the BTD acceptor will always be flanked by the less-sterically demanding six-membered rings from the two EDOTs (as opposed to the seven-member ring in ProDOT) in random copolymerizations. We hypothesize that once fully oxidized, this will allow for greater planarization across the D?A?D segment, improving delocalization of charge carriers, red-shifting the charge carrier transitions, imparting higher transmittance to the oxidized forms, and thus increasing electrochromic contrast. Calculations of the torsional energy barrier to rotation between dimers of BTD and EDOT/ProDOT are shown in Figure S1a. Computational studies were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G+(d, p) and MP2/cc-pVTZ level of theory (51, 52) using the Gaussian 09 package. (53) From their lowest relative energy conformation (0ø, Figures S1c?f are taken from angles greater than this conformation) in the neutral state, the BTD-EDOT dimer exhibits a higher torsional energy barrier to twisting away from planarity than BTD-ProDOT. Thus, the calculations support improved ?relaxation? or conjugation when EDOTs are flanking BTD vs ProDOTs. The EBE ter-heterocycle was synthesized using direct arylation coupling methods, (54) followed by purification via sublimation, and washing the resulting red solid with methanol. All polymers in this study were synthesized via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DArP). The final structures are shown in Scheme 2 (specific synthetic methods used can be found in the Supporting Information). Polymer molecular weight was analyzed with gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) in chloroform (results shown in Figure S2), and the number weight-average, dispersity, and degree of polymerization (Mn (kDa), PDI, Xn) relative to polystyrene standards are as follows: Ac-Ac/EBE (27.9, 2.10, 40), Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30 (41.9, 3.38, 52), Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35 (44.7, 4.48, 55), Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 (50.9, 3.20, 64), and Pro-Pro/EBE (68.0, 3.17, 78). Ac-Ac/EBE has the lowest weight, a kinetic effect, which may be attributed to a steric barrier to oxidative addition of the bulkier aryl dibromide, resulting in reduced conversion (Xn) and lower Mn. As the steric barrier is reduced with addition of ProDOTs, the molecular weights increase. The molecular weights obtained were sufficient to cast thin solid films onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass for electrochromic characterization. Scheme 2.

To this end, a Suzuki polycondensation was employed to give the desired alternating ProDOT?phenylenepolymer, as shown in Scheme 1.

In addition, using a particular feed ratio of two different monomers, the discrete absorption bands merged into a broad absorption across the entire visible spectrum. The spray-cast polymer thin film exhibited a deep black neutral state and attained a highly transmissive state when fully oxidized. Due to the synthetic complexity of the polymer, which involved the synthesis and chromatographic separation of DAD trimers, and which may limit reproducible large-scale production of the material, we desired to develop a method that would lead to polymer batches with highly reproducible absorption spectra and an efficient, scalable and consistent polymerization process. As illustrated by Figure 1a, we demonstrate a facile synthetic approach to access black-to-transmissive electrochromic polymers via a random transition-metal mediated coupling polyðmerization. In the specific instance reported here, we use a Stille polymerization; however the method could be applied to many other transition-metal mediated reactions that include Suzuki, Negishi, and Kumada couplings. Under the most common Stille polymerization conditions, two monomers (typically an aryl distannane and an aryl dihalide) are cross-coupled using <span class=\"catalyst\">palladium</span> catalysis to produce polymers with pre-determined Ar-Ar? couplings.33-35 In this approach, we desired to incorporate a random mixture of donor and acceptor heterocycles in order achieve a black polymer by utilizing more than two monomeric species in the polymerizations.36, 37 In order to simulate the ratio of electron-rich to electron-poor heterocycles determined in our previous work, we chose to randomly polymerize both 2,5-dibromo- and 2,5-tributylstannyl-2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT-(CH2OEtHx)2) with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) in different feed ratios. In an optimization of the feed ratio, five random broadly absorbing copolymers (ECP-1 through ECP-5) were produced, with number average molecular weights (Mn) around 10 to 15 kDa and polydispersities ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 after fractionation (see Supporting Information, Table S1). Two additional syntheses of polymer ECP-3 were under taken to demonstrate successful repeatability. The generated polymers ECP-3-s1 and ECP-3-s2 are consistent with ECP-3 in terms of molecular weight (Mn), PDI and solution absorption (see Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S1). As expected, by controlling the feed ratio of the monomers, we were able to effectively manipulate the absorption pattern of the polymers.\\n```\\n\\nThis markup includes the identification of palladium as a catalyst, which is a common catalyst used in Stille coupling reactions.

The soluble oligomeric analogues M1, M2, and M3 were synthesized by symmetrical and repeated substitution of the donor 3,4-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene (DOT-(OEtHx)2) onto the acceptor core 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) (ref. 32); the molecular structures of M1, M2, and M3 are shown in Fig. 1a; absorption spectra are reported in Supplementary Information, Fig. S1.

We attribute the dark wine hue of P3 to its overall high visible absorbance with minimal red-light transmission. This observation led us to replace the DOT moiety with the strongly donating 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT-(CH2OEtHx)2), which possesses a higher highest occupied molecular orbital and should substantially narrow the bandgap of its subsequent polymer without the need to exchange BTD for a stronger acceptor; the molecular structures of M5, M6, M7, P5, P6, and P7 are shown in Fig. 2a; absorption spectra of the oligomers are reported in Supplementary Information, Fig. S2. As a method to overcome the persistent lack of coverage in the blue and green regions of the visible region, we reasoned that by copolymerizing M5 and M8 (monomer of the subsequent control polymer P8) in a random fashion but in an appropriate feed ratio, the resulting hybrid would exhibit the extensive absorption from 400 to 700?nm required for a black chromophore. This is indeed the case and an optimal ratio was found to be one equivalent of M5 to four equivalents of M8, as illustrated in Fig. 3a and corresponding to that of the repeat unit composing the well-defined analogue P7 in terms of electron-rich to -poor substituents incorporated. The molecular composition of the resulting polymer P9 was confirmed by NMR and elemental analysis; see Supplementary Information, Table S1.

The synthetic details for the preparation of each monomer are given in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1). All of the monomers used were straightforward to produce and are highly scalable from available starting materials. Boronate monomers can generally be produced in high yield using Miyaura borylation or lithium halogen exchange, often with recrystallization as the only purification step. Additionally, recent advances in iridium catalyzed borylation allowed us to access the 2,7-bisborylated pyrene efficiently. (25) Suzuki polycondensation under optimized conditions was chosen as the method to synthesize the polymers as boronic esters are generally environmentally benign. (26) Scheme 1 Scheme 1.

Optimization of a model reaction of 4-chlorotoluene (1) with 2 led to the conditions shown in eq 1. As in Fu\\x92s examples,13 the TfO group of the boronic acid remained intact under these conditions, and longer oligoarene byproducts were not produced. While <span class=\"base\">KF</span> also worked as a base, <span class=\"base\">K3PO4</span> was found to be slightly more active, giving 3 in higher yield. There are some examples in the literature of reactions of aryl triflates with phenylboronic acids bearing a Cl group.17 Screening of catalytic conditions for a model reaction of 4 with 5 showed that the conditions shown in eq 2 were optimal. A combination of <span class=\"catalyst\">Pd(OAc)2</span> (<span class=\"ligand\">3 mol %</span>) and <span class=\"ligand\">PCy3</span> (<span class=\"ligand\">6 mol %</span>) also gave 6 in good yield (75%), but a small amount of the terphenyl byproduct was formed through an overreaction (over-cross-coupling) at the Cl group. Therefore, we decided to use <span class=\"ligand\">1,10 -bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF)</span> for this chemoselective cross-coupling.17b We then applied the reaction conditions to oligomer synthesis, as shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis began with chloroarene 7. Alternating use of the Cl-selective and TfO-selective conditions afforded 12 in 4 steps, demonstrating that the repetitive one-step method really worked. The yields in each step were not excellent (72-83%), but over-cross-coupling was not observed. Slight modifications of the conditions in eqs 1 and 2 were required for some steps: the third and fourth steps were found to require higher temperatures, greater amounts of the <span class=\"catalyst\">catalysts</span>, and larger volumes of <span class=\"solvents\">solvents</span> to increase the fluidity of the reaction mixtures. While the target quinquephenyl was arbitrarily chosen, this result strongly suggests that the method under discussion is applicable to the synthesis of various types of oligoarene. In this repetitive one-step method, the alternating use of triflates and chlorides in a different order was expected to work equally well. To demonstrate this, we started with aryl triflate 4, instead of 7, with the aim of synthesizing the same quinquephenyl backbone as 12 (Scheme 2). In this way, quinquephenyl 16 was produced in 4 steps by using the two catalytic systems alternately. In this case, the yields in the steps (93-99%) were higher than those in the previous synthesis (Scheme 1). Although the reason for the higher yields is unclear, we assume that slight differences in the solubility of the substrates are responsible. We next carried out the synthesis of multisubstituted oligoarenes using boronic acids with substituents. An example is shown in Scheme 3. Multisubstituted quaterphenyl 22 was produced in good yield. It should be mentioned that the cross-coupling conditions for chloroarene 18 had to be modified in this synthesis. When 18 was subjected to the conditions described above (<span class=\"catalyst\">Pd2(dba)3</span>, <span class=\"ligand\">P(t-Bu)3 3 HBF4</span>, <span class=\"base\">K3PO4</span>), some aldehydes and a byproduct in which the Cl group was substituted with H were obtained (7-9%). These byproducts are likely to be produced through Pd-mediated oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group and Pd-mediated reduction of the Cl group with the hydride generated by the oxidation step.18 However, we were pleased to find that the use of <span class=\"base\">KF</span> instead of <span class=\"base\">K3PO4</span> suppressed the formation of these byproducts to a significant extent. Therefore, we used <span class=\"base\">KF</span> as the base, albeit slightly less active, throughout the synthetic route. The result shown in Scheme 3 demonstrates that various functional groups, including ester, free hydroxy, alkoxy, and fluoro groups, can be installed into oligoarene structures. Another example of multisubstituted oligoarene synthesis is shown in Scheme 4. The third step from 24 to 25 resulted in modest yield. In addition, 25 and remaining 24 could not be separated. Therefore, the mixture (24:25 = ca. 2:3) was subjected to the next reaction with 17 without isolation of 25. The reaction preferentially occurred at the TfO group of 25 over the Cl group of 24 to produce sexiphenyl 26, which was now isolated with ease. The results of synthesis of these arbitrarily chosen oligoarenes strongly suggest that combinatorial uses of monomer precursors should enable preparation of various oligoarenes by this method.\\n```',\n",

              "Palladium-catalyzed direct heteroarylation polymerization (DHAP) conditions previously used to synthesize electron-rich ECPs were followed for the synthesis of each DAT-co-ProDOT copolymer. (72??74) Polymerizations were performed in <span class=\"solvent\">N,N-dimethylacetamide</span> at 140 ôC using <span class=\"catalyst\">palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2)</span> as the catalyst, <span class=\"base\">potassium carbonate (K2CO3)</span> as the base, and <span class=\"ligand\">pivalic acid (PivOH)</span> as the proton shuttle. It is worth noting that attempts using 3,4-bis(octyl)thiophene as the dihydro comonomer yielded an oligomeric material with number-average molecular weights (Mn) ?ª4.0??7.0 kg/mol as measured via size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) versus polystyrene (PS) standards. Historically, dioxythiophene-based copolymers with Mn values below 10.0 kg/mol neither exhibit sufficient film forming properties during processing for materials with robust redox switching, nor are the polymers in their limit of conjugation length as needed for saturated electronic properties. (75) This motivated the use of Br2-DAT as the dibromo comonomer for polymerization protocols, as shown in Scheme 2. By switching monomer functionality and the corresponding sequence of participation in the DHAP catalytic cycle, copolymers using the respective ProDOT as dihydro comonomers were successfully synthesized. All of the copolymers were isolated in excellent yields (>80%) with similar Mn (20??30 kg/mol) and dispersities (Dè = 2.1??3.6) as measured by SEC (Figure S8) and are reported in Table 1. Additionally, as tabulated in Table 1, elemental analyses reveal each copolymer is obtained with high compositional purity, which is necessary to establish accurate structure??property relationships.
